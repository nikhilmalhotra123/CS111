lab1a.c:
This file changes the terminal to character-at-a-time, no echo mode. Through the --shell=program option, the file forks and executes the program on a separate child process while piping input from the keyboard to that process and echoing the process output on the terminal.

Makefile:
This contains commands that can compile lab1a.c, run it, compress all files into a tarball, and cleanup files.
