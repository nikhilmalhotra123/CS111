lab1b-client.c:
This file changes the terminal to character-at-a-time, no echo mode. It then connects to a server on the specified port and sends all input to the server (with the option to compress through --compress) and outputs all data received from the server to standard output.

lab1b-server.c:
Through the --shell=program option, the file forks and executes the program on a separate child process. The server creates a socket connection and waits till a client connects. It then redirects all input from the client to the child process and sends all the output of the child process to the client with the option to compress the data.

Makefile:
This contains commands that can compile lab1b-client.c and lab1b-server, run them, compress all files into a tarball, and cleanup files.
